# UFPD-Battery-Locations
A short script I wrote to pull sexual battery data from a UFPD crime log.

This was done for the Gainesville Sun as part of an investigation into how fraternity men are able to use bars in their rooms as a pretext to lure women into vulnerable situations, increasing the incicidence of sexual assault.
